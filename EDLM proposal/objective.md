## Objective

What I'm mainly trying to achieve:

* Increase the quality and consistency of the (already 
astonishingly excellent) documentation;
* Allow for easier collaboration and review of proposed 
and published documents;
* Maintain an easy work flow for everyone.

What I'm mainly trying to get rid of:

* Variations in style or formatting;
* Older documents not updated to the latest layout/formatting;
* Dead links in documents that haven't been updated for a while;
* Passing documents around during review/editing process.
* Hiccups in the publication/review process
