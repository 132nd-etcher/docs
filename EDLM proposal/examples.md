## Examples of the finished product

You can find a few documents that have been generated with the method I'm proposing 
here: [http://132virtualwing.org/docs/](http://132virtualwing.org/docs/).

And this is the Github repository in which all those documents live: 
[https://github.com/132nd-etcher/docs](https://github.com/132nd-etcher/docs).

I recommend you open a few of those documents and check them out side by side.
In particular, note how they "look and feel" the same, and how the format
is consistent across all of them.

**Note**: the 617th SOP document that is listed in the examples is obviously not 
official, but gives a nice overview of what can be done with this project
(I haven't had the time to make it perfect, but it's close enough as an example).

The very document you are reading right now has been made with EDLM (which is the
name of my project, by the way).
