## Foreword

This document contains an enhancement proposal submitted to CMD for review.

The proposal is about documentation in the //wing. I gave quite a few thoughts
about it about a year or two ago, and started to work on a project to
make it even better. The projects, and the reasons behind it, will be
explained here.

Please note that this project is in its infancy.

You may not like a part or everything of what you see, but while
functional, it is still under construction. As a tool, it is meant
to serve us, be in the lest in the way as possible, and provide
added-value to our current documents library.

That being said, everything that is laid out in this document is
actually deployed and working. This is not a concept.

I am of course open to all kind of feedback about this project,
especially at this stage!
