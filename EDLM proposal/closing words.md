# Closing words
 
 Thank you for reading that huge blob of text, I hope I 
 managed to make sense most of the time.
 
 Now that this proposal is out for review within CMD, 
 the next step, in my opinion, could be one of those two:
 
1. The proposal is rejected by CMD, in which case 
the project dies right here.
2. The proposal is accepted by CMD, and is pushed 
to all IPs for review; I'm suggesting this 
supplementary review step because a lot of our 
documentation is actually written by IPs, it would 
make sense for them to have a say in the matter.
3. Depending on IPs feedback, the project either dies,
is adapted, or adopted.
