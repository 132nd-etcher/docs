# Enhancement Proposal

//include "intro.md"

## Pros and cons

This section objectively (as much as I could) describes the pros and cons 
of the method I propose to implement.

//include "cons.md"

//include "pros.md"

## The workflow

This section describes how to *actually* create a document with this system.

It is meant as a quick walk-through of the system, to give you an idea of
what would actually be required of people willing to create or edit 
documents if we decide to adopt it.

//include "workflow.md"

## Text formatting

So how is text formatted if we're not using Word? With Markdown!

Before we dive in, I recommend you head to [Dillinger online Markdown editor](https://dillinger.io/).
That way, you'll be able to toy with it yourself =)

Here's a [cheat-sheet of Markdon syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
Feel free to give it a quick glance to see if it looks over-complicated, but I will go over the basics
so you can see the actual results once converted in PDF.

## Diving a bit deeper

Before I can talk about the next three features, I need to introduce a new concept: the "settings" file.

**Note**: it's perfectly Ok to *not* have a settings file, you do not need it to create a document. I'm
talking about it here for the sake of being exhaustive in my presentation.
