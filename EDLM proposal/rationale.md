## Rationale

I was working a while back on the //696 TRP (which produced no useful end-result), 
and was taken aback by many of Microsoft Word pitfalls. Why does it decide to 
auto-format so many things on my behalf ? And why can't it keep it consistent? 
Reznik and I were editing with different locale settings (fr_BE and da_DK), which 
added even more fun to the mix: different paper size, different quote characters, 
and so on ...

I've also been offered the chance to review the new //176 SOP before it officially 
came out, and the whole review process, using a proxy Google Docs temporary document 
seemed archaic and painful to me. This extra step adds a lot of undesirable overhead 
to the process.

Last example: as a side-project, I'm maintaining a knee board document written with 
Microsoft Excel, and that takes the pain to a whole new level.

I would like to propose a solution to get rid of those issues, and implement a better 
work flow for everyone. This document is published for review in order to assess how 
interested/willing people are interested to give it a try.
